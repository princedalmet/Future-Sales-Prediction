## Introduction

Predicting the future sales of a product helps a business manage the manufacturing and advertising cost of the product. There are many more benefits of predicting the future sales of a product. 


## Future Sales Prediction

The dataset given here contains the data about the sales of the product. The dataset is about the advertising cost incurred by the business on various advertising platforms. Below is the description of all the columns in the dataset:

TV: Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on TV;

Radio: Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on Radio;

Newspaper: Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on Newspaper;

Sales: Number of units sold;

So, in the above dataset, the sales of the product depend on the advertisement cost of the product

Now let’s visualize the relationship between the amount spent on advertising on newspapers and units sold:

Now let’s visualize the relationship between the amount spent on advertising on radio and units sold:

Out of all the amount spent on advertising on various platforms, I can see that the amount spent on advertising the product on TV results in more sales of the product. Now let’s have a look at the correlation of all the columns with the sales column:
## Future Sales Prediction Model

Now let’s input values into the model according to the features we have used to train it and predict how many units of the product can be sold based on the amount spent on its advertising on various platforms:

Summary

So this is how we can train a machine learning model to predict the future sales of a product. Predicting the future sales of a product helps a business manage the manufacturing and advertising cost of the product
